# Getting Started

1. Get familiar with how to use GET and POST requests with the `requests`library in Python. Once you can send and receive both kinds requests consistently, then move on to the next step. 
	1. [Requests Module Reference](https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_requests.asp)
	2. [Geeks for Geeks Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-post-requests-using-python/)
	3. [JSON Placeholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) - sample website to practice requests with
# PokeAPI and pygame

 2. Use the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to get information about a Pokemon, given it's number. You will need the name and the image of the Pokemon. For the image, you will want to download it onto your computer. You can set something up to delete the images as part of the program so they don't pile up on your computer.
 3. Then create a `pygame` application to display your image and name. Here is a quick tutorial on [pygame](https://realpython.com/pygame-a-primer/). Use the font provided for the Pokemon font.
